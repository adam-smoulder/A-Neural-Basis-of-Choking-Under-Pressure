% This is a function that is based on one in code provided to Will Bishop
% by the Shenoy lab at Stanford University during his time at JHU/APL. 
%
% It will accept a cell as input. It is expect the length of this cell will
% be even and will consist of pairs of entries.  The first entry in each
% pair should be a variable name and the second entry should be the value
% for that variable.  
%
% When this function is called it will look through the variables in the
% callers workspace, and if one of the variables in the callers workspace
% has the same name as one of the variables in the input cell, it will
% assign the value in the input cell for that variable to the variable in
% the caller's workspace.  Note that it will also do a check ot make sure
% that the value in the input cell is of the same class as the existing
% variable in the caller's workspace. 
%
%
% If there are any variables in the input cell that are not found in the
% caller's workspace, these will be passed out of the function along with
% their values in the output cell. 
%
% Usage: optsCellOut = assignOpts(optsCellIn)
%
% Inputs: 
%
%   optsCellIn - a cell of variable name - variable value pairs.  The
%   variable names should be candidate variables to look for in the
%   caller's workspace and assign new values to.  For example, the cell:
%
%       {'var1', 1, 'var2', 'cat'} 
%
%   would cause this function to look for the variable named var1 in the
%   caller's workspace and assign it value 1 if it was found.  Similiary,
%   the variable 'var2' would be assigned 'cat' if it was found.  
%
% Outputs: 
%
%   optsCellOut - a cell of variable name - variable value pairs that were
%   not found in the caller's workspace. 
%
