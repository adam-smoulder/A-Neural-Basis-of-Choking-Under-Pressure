Code for analyses from Smoulder et al. 2023, "A neural basis of choking under pressure"

To be updated at time of publication.

Note that "skipLabels" is an included field after data loading for each animal, which is used to account for either trials with abberantly high firing rate that was likely caused by artifacts of some nature (Monkey E) or delay period durations that were less than enough time for the animal's delay period dynamics to reach a steady state (Monkey R). These trials are excluded from the figures in the paper; including them does not affect interpretations (it actually increases effect sizes a bit for each of them for most figures).
